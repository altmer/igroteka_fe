# Igroteka FE

This is the frontend for my gaming backlog app.  I use it on a daily basis to keep track of video games I played/want to play/playing now. You can read more about this project on my [personal website](https://amarchenko.de/igroteka).

## Prerequisites

- [Igroteka backend](https://github.com/anmarchenko/igroteka)

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and login with `admin@skaro.com/12345678`. Have fun testing the app!
